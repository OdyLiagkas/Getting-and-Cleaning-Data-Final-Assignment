# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Final-Assignment
#### This is a repository for the final assignment of Coursera's 'Getting and Cleaning Data' offered by Johns Hopkins University.

## Files included in the repo:

#### > The md file called 'CodeBook.md' is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and all the transformations/work performed to clean up the data.

#### > The R script named 'run_analysis.R' is for performing the analysis and does the following:
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### > The file called 'output_data.txt' is the reslting file from running the R script mentioned above.
